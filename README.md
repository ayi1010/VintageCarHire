# Vintage Car Hire Website


## Purpose
This website has been created as a part of web assessment for Generation Australia's JWD program.
I have created a one-page responsive website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for a car agency listing vintage cars. 

## Strategy
To ensure I could meet all the requirements within the timeframe I adopted the following strategy:
  1. Created the main semantic tag.
  2. Divided the page into sections and worked on it one after the other.
  3. Worked on the mobile version first before the desktop version.
  4. Once I have finished the primary requirements I worked on the stretched goals.
  5. Styled the page to a theme that was suitable to a vintage car hire site.  

## Theme
The colour palette I used are:

Primary:  #cb4332
Secondary: #ffc107 with opacity 25%
background: #f8f9fa
